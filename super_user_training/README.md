# Super User Training
Welcome to the Super User Training repository. This training program is designed for advanced users who wish to gain independent access to our instruments with maximum scheduling flexibility and minimal supervision. Superusers are trusted and proficient operators who understand not only the technical use of the equipment but also the lab’s safety and data quality standards.

## Overview of the curriculum
The training curriculum is designed to be hands-on, structured, and modular, ensuring thorough understanding and practical proficiency across all instrument platforms. Below is the weekly training schedule that outlines key tasks and milestones across three primary platforms:

* LC-TQMS (Liquid Chromatography – Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry)
* LC-HRMS (Liquid Chromatography – High Resolution Mass Spectrometry)
* GC-HRMS (Gas Chromatography – High Resolution Mass Spectrometry)

The curriculum includes:

1. Instrumentation Setup
2. Sample Preparation
3. Data Acquisition
4. Data Analysis

This structured timeline allows trainees to progressively build competency, with tasks overlapping strategically across platforms to maximize lab access and learning.

## How to become a superuser

Becoming a superuser involves a multi-step process that ensures both administrative compliance and technical readiness. The pathway includes initial consultation, agreement forms, and formal training via your choice of scheduled or on-demand programs.

**Steps to become a Superuser:**

1. Initial Consultation – Meet with a lab manager or training coordinator to assess your needs and goals.
2. Superuser Agreement Form – Part 1 – A preliminary agreement outlining expectations and responsibilities.
3. iLab Request Submission – Register your intent and select your training pathway (bi-yearly or on-demand).
4. Training Program – Attend your chosen training, where you’ll complete hands-on sessions and assessments.
5. Superuser Agreement Form – Part 2 – A final confirmation of your competency and agreement to lab protocols.
6. Superuser Status Granted – You now have flexible, independent access to instrumentation as a certified superuser.
